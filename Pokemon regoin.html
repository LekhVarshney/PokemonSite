<HR><h2><p><br>Gen 1 =<font color = green> Generation I introduced the first region to the Pokémon series, which, though unnamed in the original English games, is named in Japanese as Kanto, after the region of Japan it is based on. 
The name has since passed into English, first being used in Super Smash Bros., and subsequently being noted in all games since.</h2></p> </font>
<HR><h2><p><br>Gen 2 =<font color = brown> Generation II introduced a new region to the Pokémon universe, Johto, located directly west of the Kanto region featured in Generation I. Johto's culture is notably more old-fashioned than Kanto's, especially in the more rural areas, which are more plentiful than in Kanto.</h2></p> </font>

<HR><h2><p><br>Gen 3 =<font color = blue> Hoenn is the featured region in the Generation III games, Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald games along with the Generation VI remakes. Geographically, Hoenn is located to the southwest of Kanto and Johto. The theme for the locations in the Hoenn region is that of two words used together. </h2></p> </font>
